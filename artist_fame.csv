This Cibachrome print is in generally excellent condition. The colors remain vibrant and saturated, with no apparent fading. Visible only upon very close examination are occasional deposits of retouching. When examined closely in high raking light, some shallow scratches care visible, possibly a result of processing. There is an approximately one-inch scratch in the lower right quadrant, primarily in the margin, and each margin corner is scuffed where the print has been in contact with the frame. None of the aforementioned are immediately visible nor do they detract from the overall fine appearance of this photograph.",Contemporary,Abstract
